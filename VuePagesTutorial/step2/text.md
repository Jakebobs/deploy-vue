# How do we get started with Vue?
Great question! Run the following command in the terminal to start the creation of your Vue webpage.
` npm create vue@latest `

You will now see many questions arrive in the terminal.

We want you to name your webapp "porkchop.io" , just to match our existing repo. Then answer the questions in this manner:
- Project Name : porkchop.io
    - Typescript : No
    - JSX : No
    - Vue Router for Single Page Application Development : Yes
    - Pinia : No
    - Vitest : No
    - End to End : No
    - EsLint : No
    - Vue Devtools: No

You've now created the boilerplate for our page. To make sure our git is up and running properly, upload the vue page to the repo by using:

1. ` git add . `
2. ` git commit -m message `
3. ` git push --set-upstream origin master `

Authenticate with your username and then use the PAT you created in the previous step as the password.
