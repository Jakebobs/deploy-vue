# Using GitHub CLI to deploy a repo

First run the command gh auth login to login via github.com

Then run gh repo create and create a new public repository on GitHub from scratch. Name it whatever you want but it has to end in .io for github pages to work seamlessly.

Dont add a gitignore or license. Then clone it locally. Remember the name of your repository.
