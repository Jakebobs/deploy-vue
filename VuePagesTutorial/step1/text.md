# Welcome to step 1!

We have taken the precaution of setting up a github repository for you, as well as providing the killercoda service with an access token to push to that directory. Which will allow you to only have to learn how to configure Vue for use with Github Pages.

# Why do I need to learn this?
If you want to have your own webpage as part of a resume or to allow others to more easily get an overview of your work. We think that using Vue is one of the simplest tools for perfoming this task in combination with github pages, since it can easily be set up to employ client-side routing. So you won't have to worry about a backend set up and can instead focus on the front end which your visitors will actually see.

# How do we get started?
Great question! Run the following command in the terminal to start the creation of your Vue webpage.
` npm create vue@latest `

You will now see many questions arrive in the terminal.

We want you to name your webapp "porkchop.io" , just to match our existing repo. Then answer the questions in this manner:
- Typescript : No
    - JSX : No
    - Vue Router : Yes
    - Pinia : No
    - Vitest : No
    - End to End : No
    - EsLint : No
    - Vue Devtools: No

You've now created the boilerplate for our page. Let's move on to the next step!
