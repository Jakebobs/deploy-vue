# Vue for GitHub Pages Tutorial

### Authored by: [Carl Lavö](https://github.com/miljon3) & [Jakob Ström](https://github.com/Jakebobs)

Welcome to our step by step guide on setting up a Vue.js webpage on GitHub pages.

## Why should I learn this?
Learning to incorporate an automated CI/CD pipeline into something as simple as a web page is a great start for developing an understanding of DevOps. By using client-side routing, you get to focus solely on delivering a front-end experience without needing to manage complex backend infrastructure. We think this serves as a good foundation for future, more complex DevOps workflows.

## What will I learn?

1. **Setting up a Vue.js project**: You will learn how to initialize a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI.
2. **Configuring the project for deployment on GitHub Pages**: You will configure your GitHub repository to automatically deploy your site to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.
3. **Utilizing hash and dynamic routing**: You will learn how to implement client-side hash routing, including making changes to ensure that the router automatically updates whenever new content is added.

## What are the prerequisites?

- Basic knowledge of Vue.js and JavaScript
- A GitHub account
